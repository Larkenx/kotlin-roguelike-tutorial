# Creating a Roguelike in Kotlin, KTerminal, and KDX (LibGDX bindings for Kotlin)

This repository is meant to serve as a tutorial for folks to create a roguelike using KTerminal & Squidlib in Kotlin. I will be folllowing [the complete roguelike tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/6h4z09/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) as a guide for the content that I'll be covering. Behind the scenes, KTerminal is using LibGDX, a java game development framework. Prior knowledge of Kotlin or LibGDX is definitely not required, but a decent understanding of Java is expected.
