# Creating a Roguelike in Kotlin, KTerminal, and LibGDX
> This tutorial is currently a work-in-progress. Any and all parts will probably undergo significant changes!

This repository is meant to serve as a tutorial for folks to create a roguelike using [KTerminal](https://github.com/heatherhaks/kterminal) & [Squidlib](https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib) in Kotlin. KTerminal is a Kotlin terminal renderer created by the awesome [heatherhaks](https://github.com/heatherhaks). Behind the scenes, KTerminal is using LibGDX, a java game development framework. Squidlib is a large collection of algorithms for various uses, but we'll be specifically using some of the artificial intelligence and map generation algorithms!

Prior knowledge of Kotlin or LibGDX is definitely not required, but a decent understanding of Java is helpful. I will be folllowing [the complete roguelike tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/6h4z09/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) as a guide for the content that I'll be covering.  If you'd like to get a quick crash course on the languages' basics and unique features, definitely check out this [amazing online Kotlin tutorial](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Introduction/Hello,%20world!/Task.kt) that you can work with in the browser, but it is not required.
